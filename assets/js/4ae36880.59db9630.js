It has been a bit of a hassle building this thing.\r\nDocusaurus is an amazing static website builder, BUT the build steps aren't\r\nvery clear, for me that is a bummer, I have friends who like computers and\r\nthe realm of coding but they aren't very good with Javascript and HTML and\r\nthat means they won't be able to use Docusaurus. To be fair I am not the\r\nbest with this stuff either but I can read code and figure everything\r\nout. Some of the issue was my fault, Just getting this blog post out was a\r\nhassle as I was changing the default authors from the current Facebook ones\r\nto me, yeah I couldn't do that without breaking everything. I probably just\r\nneed to learn how to use Docusaurus and I will be just fine.
