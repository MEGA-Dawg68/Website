Today we shall be gaining administrator rights without \\r\\nrequiring any passwords from current admins. This took me years\\r\\nto finally perfect and get working.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Quick Disclaimer\\r\\nThe way my school gives devices out is that my parents pay **$1400**\\r\\nfor a Microsoft Surface Go 2. You could buy a Go **3** for $800!\\r\\nThey also install all of the school rubbish on top of it. We don\'t\\r\\nget administator rights as well. If you are in a situation like this\\r\\nthen, I support you hacking the computer, if you are given the device\\r\\nfor free, then I can\'t exactly put my support behind you, but I\'m \\r\\nnot going to stop you. However, one major thing I want to say is \\r\\n***I DO NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS***\\r\\nWith that out of the way, lets begin!\\r\\n\\r\\n## Prerequisites\\r\\n- Another computer (With Admin Rights)\\r\\n- An usb stick\\r\\n- Your Bitlocker recovery key (Will explain later)\\r\\n- An unlocked BIOS/UEFI (Will explain later)\\r\\n- Sticky Keys is turned on (Press shift five times)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Lets Start!\\r\\n### Windows\\r\\nTo begin, we are going to need the usb and the other computer, launch\\r\\na web browser of your choice on the other computer and head to https://www.system-rescue.org/Download/\\r\\nclick on the blue text that says .iso at the end either Source Forge\\r\\nor Fastly. When it has downloaded we need a tool to put the .iso file\\r\\non the usb. Head to [rufus.ie](rufus.ie), scroll down to downloads and click\\r\\non the first .exe you see ![rufus download](./rufus-web.png)\\r\\nonce that is downloaded, insert the flash drive and open rufus, it should\\r\\nlook like this ![rufus open](./rufus-open.png)\\r\\nclick on the select button and find the .iso file we downloaded before\\r\\nyour rufus should look like this ![rufus open](./rufus-full.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you get a pop up that says write in iso mode or dd mode, choose\\r\\niso mode. once that has finished, continue onto bitlocker!\\r\\n\\r\\n### Mac OS\\r\\nTo begin, we are going to need the usb and the other computer, launch\\r\\na web browser of your choice on the other computer and head to https://www.system-rescue.org/Download/\\r\\nclick on the blue text that says .iso at the end either Source Forge\\r\\nor Fastly. When it has downloaded we need a tool to put the .iso file\\r\\non the usb. Head to [https://etcher.balena.io/](https://etcher.balena.io/),\\r\\n![Balena](./Balena-web.png) \\r\\nand click download on Mac OS, go through the \\r\\nset up, insert the flash drive and open Balena, it should look like \\r\\nthis ![Balena open](./Balena-open.jpg)\\r\\nclick on the flash from file \\r\\nbutton and find the .iso file we downloaded before, select target and \\r\\nflash! once that has finished, continue onto bitlocker!\\r\\n\\r\\n### Linux\\r\\nYou can follow the steps for Mac OS, except download the linux variant\\r\\nIm sorry but I could get any photos, I am a linux guy as well but my \\r\\ndistro (Zorin OS) is broken.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Bitlocker\\r\\nTo tell if you have bitlocker, go to file explorer and press This PC\\r\\nif you have a lock on the C: Drive, you have bitlocker and need to follow\\r\\nthese steps. If you do not have bitlocker, skip this step\\r\\nIf bitlocker is enabled on your school computer, we are going to need\\r\\nto get your bitlocker recovery key, this is vital to gain administrative\\r\\nprivileges. So to get your bitlocker password, go to [office.com](https://office.com)\\r\\nand login with your school account and in the top right corner press\\r\\nyour profile picture \\r\\n![name and email censored](./ms-account.png) now\\r\\npress view account. In there click on devices. You should see a list of devices\\r\\n***IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU SELECT THE CORRECT DEVICE HERE***\\r\\nTo find the correct device go into settings on the school laptop, go to\\r\\nabout your PC, there should be the name of the device. For example,\\r\\n![Device name](./name-of-device.png)\\r\\nGo back to the list of devices and select the **Correct** device\\r\\nnow press view bitlocker keys and press show recovery key, \\r\\n**Write this down, you will not be able to proceed without it**.\\r\\nIf you see two operating system drives, write down both. Alright you can\\r\\nproceed to the next section!\\r\\n\\r\\n## Disabling Secure Boot\\r\\n(If your device does not support secure boot you can skip this step)\\r\\nTo boot System Rescue, we are going to need to disable secure boot \\r\\nthis step varies between devices, I have knowledge on Surface devices\\r\\nI will be using a microsoft surface for the example. You can look up on\\r\\nthe internet how to disable Secure Boot on XXXX (Your device type).\\r\\nTo begin, we are going to hold shift on the restart button in the start\\r\\nmenu. You will be greeted by a menu at has a few option like Continue,\\r\\nUse a device and troubleshoot. We want to go into troubleshoot, then\\r\\nAdvanced options, now press UEFI Firmware Settings. You should be greeted\\r\\nby a screen that says UEFI in it.\\r\\nGo into Security, press on secure boot, now press disabled. Go to exit \\r\\nand press restart now. Your computer will reboot and land on a screen \\r\\nlike this\\r\\n![Bitlocker Recovery](./Bitlocker-recovery.jpg)\\r\\nenter in the key you copied down before, it should be correct and it should\\r\\ncontinue and you should end up back in Windows, login\\r\\n\\r\\n## Booting System Rescue\\r\\nhold shift and press restart, you should end up back in that menu from \\r\\nbefore, we want to press Use a device, you should see EFI USB Device, \\r\\nselect that, your computer should reboot and end up on a screen like\\r\\nthis ![System Rescue](./sys-rescue-boot.jpg) select the first option.\\r\\n**DO NOT RESTART THE COMPUTER** you will see a bunch of \\"Hacker Code\\", don\'t\\r\\nworry, that is normal. You should end up on a screen like this \\r\\n![System Recue CLI](./sys-rescue-cli.jpg)\\r\\nWe now want to type \'startx\' (Without the quotes). you should end up seeing\\r\\na blue mouse in the middle of the screen. You have successfully booted\\r\\nSystem Rescue \\r\\n**Tip: open this article in system rescue with firefox, you will need to connect to the internet**\\r\\n\\r\\n## Removing Bitlocker\\r\\nIf you did not have bitlocker, you may skip this step\\r\\nAlright to start, \\r\\nOpen up a terminal window (the little $_ icon)\\r\\nWe now want to start a tool called dislocker. First we need to enter some\\r\\ncommands. We need to start with these commands ```sudo mkdir -p /media/decrypt``` and\\r\\n```sudo mkdir -p /media/windows-mount``` once you have entered those in we need to\\r\\nget the partition info of the bitlocked drive. To do that, on the taskbar, you\\r\\nshould see a little hard drive, click on that. It should show something like this\\r\\n![GParted](./gparted.jpg)\\r\\nfind where it says bitlocker and double click it, now where it says Path copy it\\r\\nnow go back to your terminal and enter this command \\r\\n```sudo dislocker <partition_name> -p<recovery_password> -- /media/decrypt```\\r\\nChange the partition name to your path (copy and paste. Copy is ctrl+c and paste is ctrl+shift+v)\\r\\nYou also what to change the ```<recovery_password>``` to your bitlocker recovery key.\\r\\n**There should be no space between your recovery key and the -p**\\r\\nfor example\\r\\n![Example](./dislocker-example.jpg) \\r\\n(my colour will be different from yours)\\r\\nclick enter and if it works, there should be no errors. If there are, try again and\\r\\nmake sure the recovery key is correct.\\r\\nWe now want to run another command, this one will allow us to change files on our computer\\r\\n```sudo mount -o loop /media/decrypt/dislocker-file /media/windows-mount```\\r\\nFf you have entered the command in correctly you should not get any errors\\r\\nCongratulations you have successfully removed bitlocker! You move onto the next\\r\\nsection.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Setting up the system to gain administrator rights\\r\\n***THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE TO PULL OUT NOW. IF YOU CONTINUE NOW AND YOU BREAK SOMETHING, YOU WILL HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT TO YOUR I.T DEPARTMENT***\\r\\nIf you want to pull out, you can go to the X in the corner and press log out and restart. Do not forget to turn secure boot back on\\r\\nIf you want to continue, then lets keep going\\r\\npress on the home folder on your desktop now press ```windows-mount``` on the side bar,\\r\\nyou should a bunch of folders like $RECYCLE.BIN You want to scroll down until you see a\\r\\nfolder called Windows, in there scroll down until you see a another folder named system32.\\r\\nIf you are in system32 you want to find a file called ```cmd.exe``` you want to **copy** that.\\r\\nYou want to open another file explorer (Don\'t close the current one, make sure you can \\r\\nstill see cmd.exe) and go to system32 again and now find another file named ```sethc.exe``` \\r\\nyou want to rename that to sethc2.exe, now go to the cmd.exe and rename that to sethc.exe,\\r\\nnow paste the cmd.exe you copied before. Now you should see cmd.exe appear. If have done this\\r\\ncorrect, then you should now be ready for the next section!\\r\\n\\r\\n## Gaining Admin rights\\r\\nYou are nearly done! If you have followed this far, it is safe to brag to your friends\\r\\nthat you are a master hacker. Lets begin the final steps! If you have completed last step\\r\\nsuccessfully, you should be on your lock screen, you now want to spam the shift button on\\r\\nyour keyboard, you should see a black box appear called sethc.exe. You have now bypassed \\r\\nschool admin rights! now, in the black box you want to type ```compmgmt.msc``` a window\\r\\nshould show up that looks like this ![Computer Management](./computer-mgmt.png)\\r\\nnow go to local users and groups, then users,\\r\\n**This part depends on your school setup**\\r\\nnow right click on administrators, click set password and set a password. Now press properties, \\r\\nthere should be a check box that says account is disabled, if that is checked then uncheck \\r\\nit. If it is already unchecked then close the properties and right click and select change\\r\\npassword, change the password.\\r\\n*If you get an error about password requirements while trying to enable the account, then close properties and right click and set password*,\\r\\ndepending on the password requirements, your password might have to be long. Once you have\\r\\nfinshed setting the password, close all of the windows opened and restart the computer.\\r\\nNow on the lock screen, you should see an account called administrator, log into that.\\r\\nIf you don\'t see the account. go into other users and type for the username: \\r\\nadministrator (**Must be spelled correctly**) and whatever password you set\\r\\n**Now you are done!**\\r\\n\\r\\n## What can you do now?\\r\\nYou can do whatever you like! You now control the computer. Somethings I recommend are to \\r\\nset your school account to administrator in settings and users. Use that account instead as\\r\\nusing administrator might cause suspision as you login in front of teachers and snitches.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Congratulations!\\r\\nYou are now a hacker! You have bypassed the school I.T! Impressive achievement may I say!\\r\\nGo brag to your friends, share them this article so they can do this as well, and maybe\\r\\nthe school will realise that installing school rubbish isn\'t a good idea.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Thanks for reading my blog post\\r\\nThis took a long time to make, and you reading it justifies me making more hacking blog posts.\\r\\nAnd with that, I bid you a farewell!"},{"id":"welcome-docusaurus-v2","metadata":{"permalink":"/Website/blog/welcome-docusaurus-v2","editUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ/blog/2023-12-22-my-first-post.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-22-my-first-post.md","title":"Welcome to my blog","description":"This is my first post on My website.","date":"2023-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 22, 2023","tags":[{"label":"hello","permalink":"/Website/blog/tags/hello"},{"label":"general","permalink":"/Website/blog/tags/general"}],"readingTime":0.75,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"MEGA-Dawg68","title":"Creator of this blog","url":"https://github.com/MEGA-Dawg68","image_url":"https://www.peanuts.com/sites/default/files/sn-color.jpg","imageURL":"https://www.peanuts.com/sites/default/files/sn-color.jpg"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Welcome to my blog","description":"This is my first post on My website.","slug":"welcome-docusaurus-v2","authors":[{"name":"MEGA-Dawg68","title":"Creator of this blog","url":"https://github.com/MEGA-Dawg68","image_url":"https://www.peanuts.com/sites/default/files/sn-color.jpg","imageURL":"https://www.peanuts.com/sites/default/files/sn-color.jpg"}],"tags":["hello","general"],"image":"https://www.github.com/MEGA-Dawg68.png","hide_table_of_contents":false},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How to Bypass Administrator Rights on Windows 10, 11","permalink":"/Website/blog/2023/12/24/Gaining-Admin-rights-on-windows-10-and-11/How to hack school computer"}},"content":"Welcome to my website! It has been a bit of a hassle building this thing. \\r\\nDocusaurus is an amazing static website builder, BUT the build steps aren\'t \\r\\nvery clear, for me that is a bummer, I have friends who like computers and \\r\\nthe realm of coding but they aren\'t very good with Javascript and HTML and\\r\\nthat means they won\'t be able to use Docusaurus. To be fair I am not the \\r\\nbest with this stuff either but I can read code and figure everything \\r\\nout. Some of the issue was my fault, Just getting this blog post out was a\\r\\nhassle as I was changing the default authors from the current Facebook ones\\r\\nto me, yeah I couldn\'t do that without breaking everything. I probably just\\r\\nneed to learn how to use Docusaurus and I will be just fine. But still, \\r\\nDocusaurus should really revise their getting started guide."}]}')}}]);
