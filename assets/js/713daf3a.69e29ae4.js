It has been a bit of a hassle building this thing. \\r\\nDocusaurus is an amazing static website builder, BUT the build steps aren\'t \\r\\nvery clear, for me that is a bummer, I have friends who like computers and \\r\\nthe realm of coding but they aren\'t very good with Javascript and HTML and\\r\\nthat means they won\'t be able to use Docusaurus. To be fair I am not the \\r\\nbest with this stuff either but I can read code and figure everything \\r\\nout. Some of the issue was my fault, Just getting this blog post out was a\\r\\nhassle as I was changing the default authors from the current Facebook ones\\r\\nto me, yeah I couldn\'t do that without breaking everything. I probably just\\r\\nneed to learn how to use Docusaurus and I will be just fine. But still, \\r\\nDocusaurus should really revise their getting started guide."}]}')}}]);
