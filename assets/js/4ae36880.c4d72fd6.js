To be fair I am not the\r\nbest with this stuff either but I can read code and figure everything\r\nout. Some of the issue was my fault, Just getting this blog post out was a\r\nhassle as I was changing the default authors from the current Facebook ones\r\nto me, yeah I couldn't do that without breaking everything.
