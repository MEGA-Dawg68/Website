            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to my website! It has been a bit of a hassle building this thing.
Docusaurus is an amazing static website builder, BUT the build steps aren't
very clear, for me that is a bummer, I have friends who like computers and
the realm of coding but they aren't very good with Javascript and HTML and
that means they won't be able to use Docusaurus. To be fair I am not the
best with this stuff either but I can read code and figure everything
out. Some of the issue was my fault, Just getting this blog post out was a
hassle as I was changing the default authors from the current Facebook ones
to me, yeah I couldn't do that without breaking everything. I probably just
need to learn how to use Docusaurus and I will be just fine. But still,
Docusaurus should really revise their getting started guide.</p>]]></content:encoded>
